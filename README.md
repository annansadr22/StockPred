## 🚀 How to Run It Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/annansadr22/StockPred.git
cd StockPred
```

---

### 2. Train the ML Model

> Run this once to prepare your trained model and preprocessed dataset.

```bash
cd stock_api
python train_model.py
```

This will generate:

- `rf_model.joblib`
- `scaler.joblib`
- `label_encoder.joblib`
- `cleaned_stock_data.csv`

These files are used by the FastAPI backend for AI predictions.
